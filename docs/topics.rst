Key File Support
================

keepassx fully supports key files.  You can provide a key file
through the ``-k/--key-file`` argument or the ``KP_KEY_FILE``
environment variable.  A key file can be used either as an alternative to a
password or in combination with a password.  By using both a key file and
a password to secure your password database, you will require both something
you know (your password) and something you have (your keyfile) in order to
access the entries in the password database.  For more information on key
files, see the `keepass docs <http://keepass.info/help/base/keys.html#keyfiles>`_.
