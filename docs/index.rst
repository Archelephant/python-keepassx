   contain the root `toctree` directive.

===============
python-keepassx
===============

KeePassX is a cross platform password manager.  However, KeePassX is a desktop
GUI application.  That's where python-keepassx comes in.  By using python-keepassx,
you can access your passwords using a command line interface to KeePassX.  You can
also use the python library directly in your own python applications.


What is this project and why should I care?
-------------------------------------------

Keepassx is a great password manager.  However, if you're like me, you're in
the terminal frequently.  It would be better if you could access your passwords
in the terminal, or even better, in the python code you write.  python-keepassx
can read and write the database files that keepassx uses, and in doing so
allows you to access your passwords.


I've never heard of a password manager, what is it?
---------------------------------------------------


I'd like to try out this project, what do I do?
-----------------------------------------------

Check out the :doc:`gettingstarted` for an introduction
to using python-keepassx.


I just want reference/API docs, where are they?
